This README provides the steps required to run the project model

1) After installing Anaconda Navigator and Python.
2) Install the requisite Python Libraries such as  Numpy and Pandas,matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, sklearn. These  would be prompted by Anaconda if uninstalled.
3) Launch Jupyter Notebooks  and open ChronicDisease_AI.ipynb
4) Replace the directory path  of the  dataset: chronic_kidney_disease.csv with your machine's location  of that file.
5) Similarly, do the same for the test set which is: ckdpreddata.csv
6) Run the cells in Jupyter  one by one. 
7) The python notebook has comments on what each code does.
8) The project model is now completely executed!
